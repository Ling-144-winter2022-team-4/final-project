FADE IN:
INT. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - SOMETIME
A BRIGHT, BUZZING FLUORESCENT LIGHT. All the sounds of
hospital fuss.
THE CAMERA tilts down and dollies in fast between the legs of
a WOMAN giving birth and -
INT. WOMB - CONTINUOUS
A fetus. A fetus like any other. Okay, a person. A BABY. A
baby in the middle of a fucking nightmare, as it curls up,
bracing itself to be torn from the comfort of its home.
RUE (V.O.)
I was once happy. Content. Sloshing
around in my own private,
primordial pool. Then one day, for
reasons beyond my control, I was
repeatedly crushed, over and over,
by the cruel cervix of my mother,
Leslie.
WE SEE and FEEL each CONTRACTION as it bears down on sweet
BABY RUE. Each time she’s squeezed, her body shudders as if
shot with a taser gun. Over and over and over, until
something gives way and...
WE ENTER:
INT. BIRTH CANAL - CONTINUOUS
This is a sordid journey, as Baby Rue makes her bone crushing
descent through the dark labyrinth of her mother.
SFX: Crunching, faint echoes, sloshing waters, suction, a
faint scream from outside, bizarre radio waves...
A PIN OF LIGHT as we go rushing toward it, like a subway
train out of hell.
RUE (V.O.)
I put up a good fight, but I lost.
For the first time, but not the
last. 
The growing SOUND of a rumbling, ground shaking wave as the
LIGHT grows bigger, whiter, brighter...
QUICK DISSOLVE:
EXT. NEW YORK CITY - A SUNNY, CLOUDLESS DAY
As Flight 175 United Airlines silently crashes into the North
Tower. [ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE]
WE WATCH the plume of smoke, fire, and debris rain down the
side of the building.
RUE (V.O.)
I was born three days after 9/11.
CUT TO:
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SOMETIME
BABY RUE, seconds old, her body covered in blood and birth
slime, is lifted towards CAMERA. Her lungs fill with air, and
her eyes blink open.
POV thru the foggy eyes of NEW RUE: A TV SET, mounted on the
wall:
George W. Bush, standing atop Ground Zero, bullhorn in hand.
SLOW ZOOM IN on RUE’S face.
GEORGE W. BUSH
I can hear you!
SLOW ZOOM in on TV SET.
GEORGE W. BUSH (CONT’D)
I can hear you! The rest of the
world hears you, and the people who
knocked these buildings down will
hear all of us soon.
As the RESCUE WORKERS begin to chant:
RESCUE WORKERS
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
CU on the face of Baby Rue, transfixed by the speech and the
patriotic chants.
A BEAT. She begins to wail with terror.
2.
Suddenly, A NIPPLE is shoved in her mouth. She sucks. And in
an instant her eyes roll back in a drug-like haze.
A SERIES OF SHOTS:
RUE (V.O.)
My mother and father spent two days
in the hospital, holding me under
the soft glow of the television,
watching those towers fall over,
and over, and over again. Until the
feelings of grief and the chills of
horror gave way to numbness.
The TELEVISION clicks off. Plunging us into -
BLACK:
RUE (V.O.)
And then, without warning, a white
suburban American middle class
childhood.
INT. THERAPIST’S OFFICE - DAY
AS THE CAMERA DOLLIES IN on a THERAPIST, hands clasped, a
gentle smile.
THERAPIST
I would say she’s suffering from--
REVERSE. DOLLY IN ON 4 y/o Rue, striped pajamas, squeezed
between two large bodies that we can only assume are her
parents.
RUE (V.O.)
I wasn’t physically abused.
THERAPIST
Attention Deficit Disorder.
RUE (V.O.)
Never had a shortage of clean
water...
THERAPIST
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.
RUE (V.O.)
Wasn’t molested by a family member.
THERAPIST
General Anxiety Disorder.
3.
RUE (V.O.)
And up until that point, hadn’t
experienced any more trauma than
anybody else.
THERAPIST
And possibly Bipolar Disorder.
(a hesitant beat)
But she’s a little young to tell.
A soft gasp of tears from LESLIE, as Rue looks up,
unconcerned.
RUE (V.O.)
So explain this shit to me--
CUT TO:
ECU: A MONDAY / TUESDAY / WEDNESDAY (ET AL) PILL BOX
RAPID CUTS. 3 multi-colored pills are dropped in each day.
INT. KITCHEN TABLE - DAY
CAMERA WHIPS UP AND DOLLIES IN QUICK on Rue’s mother LESLIE,
as she sits in front of her coffee and Kashi. She slides the
pill box across the table.
And leans in.
LESLIE
It’s just the way your brain was
hard-wired. It’s no big deal,
plenty of great, intelligent,
funny, interesting, and creative
people have struggled with the same
things you struggle with.
CLOSE ON 10 y/o Rue, chubby, pale, with braces. And upon
closer inspection, she seems completely fucking catatonic.
RUE
(robotically)
Like who?
LESLIE
Lots of people you like.
RUE
But who?
4.
LESLIE
Well, um...
CUT TO:
RAPID MONTAGE OF FAMOUS PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES.
LESLIE (V.O.)
Vincent Van Gogh.
- We see VAN GOGH, 37, stands in a wheat field and shoots
himself in the chest.
LESLIE (V.O.)
Sylvia Plath.
- We see the oven flame go on as SYLVIA blows it out and then
takes a deep breath, inhaling the gas.
LESLIE (V.O.)
Or even Fiona Apple.
- We see FIONA onstage at the MTV AWARDS in 1997:
FIONA APPLE
What I want to say is, um,
everybody out there that’s
watching, everybody that’s watching
this world, this world is bullshit.
BACK TO LESLIE at the kitchen table across from catatonic Rue
LESLIE
(cheerfully)
And your favorite, Britney Spears.
- We see the FAMOUS FOOTAGE OF BRITNEY SPEARS in a barber
shop, getting her head shaved. With smeared mascara, Britney
turns and looks directly into CAMERA.
CUT TO:
INT. SIXTH GRADE CLASSROOM - DAY
11 y/o Rue sits in class, still awkward and chubby and
medicated the fuck out.
RUE (V.O.)
I don’t remember much between the
ages of 8 and 12. Just that the
world moved fast and my brain moved
slow.
(MORE)
5.
And every now and then, if I
focused too closely on the way I
breathed...
All sound is drowned out, except for Rue’s breath.
RUE (V.O.)
I’d die.
It starts to become shorter. More clipped. Until she begins
to hyperventilate. Gasping. She falls from her desk. Her hair
spilling out against the gray-white linoleum. She blinks.
The strobing fluorescents begin to shift from white to cyan
to magenta. Until a brown paper bag is placed against her
mouth and the soft voice of a teacher whispers -
SOFT VOICED TEACHER
Just breathe. 1...2...3...
CLOSE ON: The paper bag as it inflates and deflates.
ANGLE ON: Rue’s eyes as she looks up to see a circle of
gawking classmates forming. They begin to film her on the
low.
RUE (V.O.)
It’s not that my medication wasn’t
working properly. It’s that I had
yet to discover it’s full
potential.
CUT TO:
ECU: ON A LITTLE BLUE KLONOPIN FRAMED AGAINST THE VAST
EXPANSE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM
JUMP CUT: As it explodes into a fine powder.
INT. RUE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
FROM ABOVE: Rue, now 17 years old, sits cross legged in bed.
She looks up at CAMERA. Winks. AND CAMERA DROPS WITH HER as
snorts the crushed Klonopin off her solar system themed
computer case.
WE HOLD ON HER FACE as the benzo’s take effect.
SLAM CUT:
RUE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
6.
INT. RUE’S IPHOTO LIBRARY - YEARS AND YEARS
We rapidly scroll through her iPhoto library. Years of
memories. From soccer games to birthday parties to her
family. Sleepovers with best friends. Dance routines.
Selfies. Makeup. School.
RUE (V.O.)
I got my first dick pic at the age
of 9. I hadn’t even held a boy’s
hand.
And WE HOLD on a messy haired teenage boy with his arm slung
around her.
RUE (V.O.)
I had my first kiss at the age of
12 with a boy I didn’t really like,
but I just wanted to get it over
with.
A few more quick photos of said boy and we’re back to rapidly
scanning through her life. Growing up. Drinking a bottle of
wine. More selfies. Sleepless nights. A growing restlessness.
RUE (V.O.)
Two months later some egg on
Twitter threatened to BTK me, which
would have been whatever, but the
night before I watched the Jaycee
Dugard primetime dateline special,
and the combo sent me spiraling
into persistent night terrors for
two months.
The photos become more sexual, more obsessive, more focused
on how she looks. Pushing her boobs together in a mirror. Her
ass propped up against a sink.
RUE (V.O.)
But I’m buoyant and bounced back
and gave four hand jobs in eighth
grade, two blow jobs in ninth, one
of which I was emotionally coerced
into -
AND LIKE MACHINE GUN FIRE. WE CYCLE THROUGH HER PHOTOS. Her
lips. Her mouth. More makeup. More disaffected. Present.
Skirts. Shorts. Bras. Panties. The gap between her legs. The
side of her face that looks best. Her stomach from the front,
the side, standing, laying down, relaxed and sucked in.
BACK TO REAL LIFE: Rue turns to CAMERA. Gives us the middle
finger.
7.
RUE (V.O.)
Yo Mark. Go fuck yourself
INT. RUE’S BEDROOM - MORNING
ANGLE ON: Rue as she does her makeup: k-pop puppy eyes, aegyo
sal, dashes of glitter and bold lipstick.
INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - DAY
Rue exits a stall, checks her nose for traces of powder.
Drops her sunglasses.
RUE (V.O.)
And at some point you make a choice
about who you are and what you
want.
INT. SCHOOL HALLWAYS - DAY
Rue walks down the hallways with a druggy sway.
RUE (V.O.)
Every mistake, every mis-step,
every dumb decision or dumb fuck.
You own it and wear it like a badge
of honor cause the internet is
forever, and trolls keep receipts.
INT. RUE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
CLOSE ON: The CAMERA screen of an iPhone.
RUE (V.O.)
So you create your own confidence.
As RUE holds it at a distance and slowly comes into focus.
She’s sitting on her knees, her back arched, wearing a sheer
pastel pink bra, with little side eye emoji patches sewn on.
RUE (V.O.)
You piece it together. Out of empty
memes, and hashtags, and central
nervous system depressants… and you
hold your head high ‘cause every
girl’s a queen and every boy
a potential like...
8.
The CAMERA flickers as it takes a photo. WE CONTINUE TO
FOLLOW HER iPHONE SCREEN AS SHE SHIFTS TO ANOTHER ANGLE.
ANOTHER PHOTO. ANOTHER PHOTO. ANOTHER ANGLE.
We FREEZE FRAME on one as she FaceTunes it. Blur effects.
Softens her skin. Widens her eyes. Covers pimples. And
uploads it to Tumblr. Caption: Portrait of a young slut as an
artist. lol.
RUE (V.O.)
... and every day a fucking drag.
INT. RUE’S HOUSE - MORNING
As WE FOLLOW RUE through her house into the kitchen where her
little sister GEORGIA “GIA”, 13, picks at her eggs and toast
while LESLIE, 40s, argues with her insurance company on the
phone -
LESLIE (ON PHONE)
They said the facility was in our
network, how could it suddenly be
out of network? This feels like
extortion -
GIA
(looking at her phone)
Did you see the video of that
beauty queen who got acid thrown in
her face?
RUE
No.
GIA
It’s pretty fucked up.
Rue looks at her food, disinterested.
RUE
Mom, do you have any tampons?
LESLIE
(to Rue)
In my bathroom. Under the sink.
Rue walks back into her mothers bathroom. A beat. She peers
back toward the kitchen. And then... coughs loudly as she
opens the medicine cabinet. Pulls out a prescription bottle.
9.
RUE (V.O.)
- And thank you to all the suburban
mothers out there for the unending
supply of xanny bars...
RAPID CUTS (x5) as we see RUE cough loudly and open different
medicine cabinets in different bathrooms in different houses.
As she steals a few pills from various bottles.
RUE (V.O.)
- because I get it… Life is cruel
and aimless and there’s no way I
could’ve made it through school or
life or losing my virginity without
dimming the proverbial lights.
INT. RANDO FUCKBOI’S PARENTS LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
CLOSE ON: Rue’s drugged out face as some RANDO FUCKBOI
thrusts and grunts and gives it his best shot.
TY DOLLA $iGN plays out of his shitty iPhone speaker.
RUE (V.O.)
And no matter what the fuck tumblr
says, life is not a Nicholas Sparks
novel, and being a teenager is a
lot of things... but romantic? I
don’t fucking think so.
ON RUE and RANDO FUCKBOI laying on the cold tile of his
parents’ laundry room.
He turns to Rue.
RANDO FUCKBOI
Did you cum?
A long, long beat.
RUE
...Yeah.
RANDO FUCKBOI
Forreal?
RUE
...Yeah.
RANDO FUCKBOI
For real, for real?
10.
RUE
...Yeah.
RANDO FUCKBOI
Like hard?
RUE
...Yeah.
He smiles. Pleased with himself.
RANDO FUCKBOI
Werd. You look like you came hard.
Rue ekes out a druggy smile.
INT. RUE’S MOTHERS BATHROOM - MORNING
She pockets a few xanny bars, puts the bottle back and
flushes the toilet to mask the sound of the cabinet closing.
And heads back to the kitchen -
RUE
Let’s go, Gia.
EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - MORNING
FROM BEHIND: Rue holds GIA’S hand as they walk down the
street together.
RUE (V.O.)
And I know it all may seem sad, but
guess what? I didn’t build this
system, nor did I fuck it up.
INT. SCHOOL BUS - MORNING
Rue and Gia walk down the aisle of a school bus and sit in
the back. The bus takes off as the streets bend behind them.
CUT TO:
INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING
The ALARM RINGS. As the students perform a lockdown drill (in
the event of an active shooting). The lights are flipped off.
The door is locked.
11.
The windows blocked out with foam-core. And the students
huddle in a group in the corner of the classroom.
RUE (V.O.)
I just showed up one day without a
map or a compass or, to be honest,
anyone capable of giving one iota
of good fucking advice.
As WE PUSH IN on RUE. Some JOCK sitting next to her turns his
phone toward her… It’s a looping gif of Sasha Grey getting
facefucked.
He sticks his tongue in his cheek and winks at RUE who
ignores him and looks back toward CAMERA as we PUSH INTO
CLOSEUP.
RUE (V.O.)
But maybe I’m just in a mood… So
here’s a cute video of me learning
how to hula-hoop.
EXT. BACKYARD - DAY (12 YEARS AGO)
A HOME MOVIE, shot by RUE’S FATHER on an old DVR camera of
Rue at the age of five trying to hula hoop in the backyard.
She keeps trying and failing and giggling as her Dad laughs
off camera.
She looks up at her Dad, hand on her hips.
YOUNG RUE
I give up.
RUE’S FATHER
C’mon Rue, don’t give up. You can
do it.
She tries again and fails…
YOUNG RUE
I give up.
RUE’S FATHER
Don’t give up, Rue.
Fails. And we JUMP CUT as she fails and he encourages her
again and again.
RUE’S FATHER (CONT’D)
You can do it, Rue.
12.
Until finally she succeeds. They both erupt in cheers as her
Dad lifts her into the sky, YOUNG RUE’S eyes filling with
tears - as she flies amongst the clouds.
RUE (V.O.)
And if that didn’t cheer you up,
here’s me at a funeral.
EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY (PRESENT DAY)
DOLLY ACROSS a LINE OF FORLORN CHEERLEADERS as we LAND ON a
GIANT 6’ x 5’ WREATHED PHOTO of a SMILING JOCK propped up on
the 50 yard line.
This is NATE JACOBS.
NATE’S MOTHER speaks into a microphone, flanked by the cheer
squad.
ANGLE ON: RUE, sitting in the bleachers amongst the whole
town watching.
RUE (V.O.)
Last week, Nate Jacobs, star
quarterback of the football team,
was found dead in a cornfield off
Route 38...
CUT TO:
EXT. ROUTE 38 - DAY (THE WEEK BEFORE)
As the wind blows through the crops. We see TWO COPS step
into frame and peer down at a bloody and disfigured corpse.
COP
Good God.
SHERIFF
Is that Nate Jacobs?
COP
Beats the holy hell outta me.
SHERIFF
Look at the monogram.
COP
(peers closer)
Good God.
13.
SHERIFF
Coach Barnes ain’t gonna like this
turn of events.
BACK TO:
EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY
The memorial service, where Rue still watches.
RUE (V.O.)
Don’t feel bad, Nate Jacobs was a
part time alcoholic, part time
groper, full time fucking asshole.
(a beat)
And if I’m going to be entirely
honest… I’m the one who killed him.
Rue puts in her headphones, “Waste of Time,” by MØ plays. As
the cheerleaders begin to do an in memoriam routine for the
slain quarterback.
The head cheerleader, MADISON, 17, grief-stricken goes
through the motions of her routine, mascara running down her
face.
Rue slips under the stands as the CAMERA rises above the
bleachers and we see Rue walking away.
SLAM CUT:
TITLE CARD: EUPHORIA
BLACK.
SUPER: FOUR MONTHS EARLIER
RUE (V.O.)
It all started when Jules moved to
town.
EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - DAY
WE OPEN HIGH, rushing down the suburban streets of East
Highland as CAMERA DROPS DOWN on a girl riding her bike.
This is JULES, 17, trans, wearing a long white dress with a
red Japanese ribbon tie. It whips in the wind behind her.
SHE ROUNDS A CORNER as we continue through the endless sprawl
of the suburbs - a mix of single story and two story homes.
14.
This is basically the world from every John Hughes movie, but
after thirty years of Reaganomics it’s kinda lost it’s
idyllic charm. This is a cough syrup and Ritalin town with
meth on the outskirts, and no family is just coasting.
RUE (V.O.)
I didn’t know her yet but I had
definitely heard about her. Not in
that “ohmigod there’s some new,
edgy transgirl in town” way but
more like...
INT. DELI/GAS STATION - DAY
FEZCO, 21, unkempt with sweet eyes and a blank stare you only
get after attempting to eat a sheet of acid over the course
of one summer:
FEZCO
(monotone)
There’s some new, like edgy
transgirl in town.
REVERSE ON: RUE standing at the counter, looking at FEZCO man
the register.
RUE
So?
FEZCO
I don’t know. She came in yesterday
all Sailor Moon and shit and I
thought, she looks like someone Rue
would get along with...
RUE (V.O.)
Which was sorta like a dead on
observation for Fezco who’s not
normally revolving in the same
direction as planet earth. Granted
it wasn’t Sailor Moon we’d bond
over...
CUT TO:
INT. MCKAY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
WE HEAR the rumblings of a fight as WE PUSH THRU the mad
chaos of an end of summer house party. To find NATE, 18, the
star quarterback, shirtless, wasted, and agro as fuck... He’s
yelling out:
15.
NATE
If someone doesn’t speak up, this
bitch is gonna get fucked up!
He turns to JULES, standing in the kitchen, against the wall,
in a crop top, skirt, torn fishnets and a pink wig. She looks
over at the counter and sees a kitchen knife laying next to a
cut up lime.
NATE (CONT’D)
Looks like you’re all on your own.
Jules tries to walk away but Nate grabs her and throws her
back toward the wall -
RUE (V.O.)
It was the fact that she pulled a
motherfucking kitchen knife on Nate
Jacobs.
As Jules immediately REACHES OVER AND GRABS THE KITCHEN
KNIFE.
The party erupts in pandemonium. SCREAMS. SHOUTS.
AS WE FREEZE FRAME on JULES, mascara smeared, pink wig
flying, kitchen knife in hand -
RUE (V.O.)
But anyway, whatever...
FEZCO (PRELAP)
Yo Rue... you planning on paying
for those Trolli’s?
BACK TO:
INT. DELI/GAS STATION - DAY
A beat. She smiles. Shakes her head no.
FEZCO
No, seriously, you have to pay for
those. We got a security camera
while you were gone.
They both look up at the SECURITY CAMERA.
POV OF FOOTAGE. As Rue holds up a middle finger.
She turns back and reaches into her jacket and lays both
packs of Trolli Sour Worms on the counter.
16.
FEZCO (CONT’D)
When’d you get back? I thought I’d
never see you again.
RUE
Few weeks ago.
FEZCO
(hesitantly)
And how you feeling?
RUE
Ever since I gave my life over to
my lord and savior, Jesus Christ,
things have been really good.
A long beat.
RUE (CONT’D)
I’m fucking with you, Fez. I’m
still the same misanthropic whore
you’ve always known.
FEZCO
What’s that mean?
RUE
That I hate mankind. And I’m a
whore.
FEZCO
You don’t hate mankind.
RUE
That’s true. But I hate you for not
disagreeing with the whore part.
FEZCO
Well, you’ve had a long life.
She laughs.
RUE
By the way...
(beat)
Is Ashtray in the back?
FEZCO
For real, Rue?
RUE
For real.
He shakes his head, frustrated.
17.
RUE (CONT’D)
C’mon Fezco, the world is coming to
an end and I haven’t even graduated
high school.
Rue smiles sweetly at him. He relents...
FEZCO
You still gotta pay for those
Trolli’s...
RUE
Spot me.
INT. DELI TRASH ROOM - CONTINUOUS
WE FOLLOW Rue as she enters the trash room in the back.
Sitting at a small desk is ASHER “ASHTRAY,” Fezco’s 14 year
old business partner. He wears a thin gold chain.
He’s dead eyed and humorless, bagging up pills and powders.
He looks up at Rue.
ASHTRAY
I thought you were dead.
RUE
And I thought you had Asperger's
until I learned you were just a
prick.
ASHTRAY
I do have Asperger's.
RUE
But you’re still a prick.
ASHTRAY
This a fickle industry. Y’all come
and go. No hard feelings but I’m
just tryna stack enough cash to pay
off my mom’s mortgage and buy a
yacht.
He looks up.
ASHTRAY (CONT’D)
So what you want?
They stare at each other for a beat.
JUMP CUT TO:
18.
CLOSE ON: ONE PILL AFTER ANOTHER BEING BAGGED UP.
Three OC 20s, three 20s of Adderall, a gram of Molly.
He hands her the baggies and she hands him the cash.
ASHTRAY
You sure you don’t wanna try
nothing new?
RUE
Like what?
ASHTRAY
2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, 5-MeO-DIPT.
RUE
I have zero fuckin’ idea what
you’re talking about.
ASHTRAY
Doesn’t matter. But this shit...
He holds out a capsule filled with pale pink crystals.
ASHTRAY (CONT’D)
...is fucking lit.
RUE
What is it?
ASHTRAY
N-diisopropyl-5-methoxytryptamine.
A beat. Rue stares blankly at him.
WE JUMP CUT TO:
EXT. CHILDREN’S PLAYGROUND - NIGHT
LOOKING UP: Two streetlights on opposite sides of the frame.
ASHTRAY (V.O.)
It’s a fast acting psychedelic.
The SLOW MOTION SOUND of them burning out. As they shift to a
ROSE GOLD COLOR.
ANGLE ON: Rue and Jules as they both fly into FRAME on
separate swings at 72fps.
19.
ASHTRAY (V.O.)
Got some similarities to LSD but
with like, key differences. Not as
visual and shit but def a sense
distorter.
The sounds of the swing set chains, laughter, the wind
rushing against their faces.
ASHTRAY (V.O.)
Lotta auditory hallucinations,
kinda like playing a record at half
speed. And your body goes limp, not
some K-Hole wooden puppet
bullshit...
As they both JUMP OFF the SWING SETS into the AIR. They move
in ULTRA SLOW-MOTION.
ASHTRAY (V.O.)
But more that zero gravity tip you
get from good DMT.
SUPERIMPOSE: The world behind them, rapidly animates in that
(90’s Anime - ACTIVATED! Style)
CUT BACK TO:
INT. DELI TRASH ROOM - CONTINUOUS
On Ashtray:
ASHTRAY
I don’t know. Shit’s blowing up in
Tampa. And mad people like to fuck
on it.
RUE
(a long beat)
Okay.
He gives her two pills.
EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
As Rue pushes out the back door -
CAMERA DOLLIES IN QUICK ON NATE JACOBS, 18, and McKAY, 19, in
the distance loading a keg into the back of McKay’s truck.
20.
McKay is massive, built to play offensive tackle. He’s not
particularly intelligent or articulate but there’s a kindness
to him.
RUE (V.O.)
In truth, I didn’t have much of an
issue with Nate until that night. I
mean, I never liked him.
Nate is leaner, in the way quarterbacks are, and full of
himself, in the way quarterbacks are.
RUE (V.O.)
And once during the freshman
formal, he tried to finger me on
the dance floor without my
permission. But like, that’s
America.
They start up the truck, and as they pass Rue.
RUE (V.O.)
And if they were throwing an end of
summer party. Of course, I’d
fucking go.
Nate hangs out the window:
NATE
(yelling)
I’d do it for Rue!
He “Hunger Games” salutes her. WE TRACK WITH THEM IN THE CAR
as they peel out of the parking lot.
INT. MCKAY’S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
McKay drives and Nate sits shotgun.
NATE
I’m telling you bro... We’re about
to blow this shit out. The whole
fucking world’s gonna be talking
about how McKay threw the grimiest
motherfucking banger of the summer.
MCKAY
I’m just nervous cause my mom’s got
like real OCD. She’ll notice like
the smallest scratch, or like if
the dishes are in the wrong order.
21.
NATE
Stop being such a faggot. This is
like your last hurrah. Go out like
a motherfucking G.
MCKAY
You think people are excited?
NATE
Fuck yeah, dude. People are hyped
af.
McKay smiles, feeling good.
NATE (CONT’D)
Plus, I’mma get savage tonight.
MCKAY
But isn’t Maddy coming?
NATE
I don’t give a fuck. She broke up
with me. I’m a free motherfucking
man. And if she wants to come then
I’mma make her pay.
MCKAY
Dude...
NATE
Forreal. And I’m not fucking with
no basic bitches or some thottie in
a prom dress. I’mma straight seek
out the hottest piece of pussy in
that room and I’mma fucking slay
that bitch. And trust me bro...
I’mma make that shit known.
As they drive, they see JULES, 17, riding her bike home.
She’s in her same white dress as when we first met her.
NATE (CONT’D)
Yo, what the fuck is that?
MCKAY
Some girl on a bike.
NATE
What are you retarded? That’s a
dude.
MCKAY
Really?
22.
NATE
Yeah.
MCKAY
Damn.
A beat. They watch her.
NATE
Ride up on this bitch.
MCKAY
Nah c’mon.
NATE
Ride the fuck up.
MCKAY
No, dude. I don’t want to
accidentally hurt him.
NATE
(snaps)
What are you a fucking pussy?
C’mon, have some fucking fun.
McKay hesitates as Nate steps over the center console and
presses his foot on top of McKay’s on the gas pedal. The
truck roars and lurches forward.
Jules panics, veering off the side of the road and crashes
her bike.
Nate bursts into laughter as McKay turns to him, frightened.
MCKAY
Yo dude, you’re a real asshole.
Nate continues to laugh.
EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD, SUBURBS - CONTINUOUS
WE STAY with JULES where she’s crashed. She’s rattled. She
picks herself up, dirtied and bruised. She looks down at a
scrape across her hip. She winces as she touches it.
RUE (V.O.)
Jules moved from the city to the
suburbs after her mom and dad got
divorced.
She begins to walk her bike down the street.
23.
INT. JULES’ HOME - LATER
Jules enters. There’s no one home. She goes to kitchen
cabinet and pulls out a bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide.
RUE (V.O.)
She doesn’t really like to talk
about it but dads almost never get
full custody so some shit
definitely went down.
INT. JULES’ ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
She sits in her bedroom and cleans her scrape. The walls are
adorned with fashion editorials and anime cut outs...
RUE (V.O.)
She went to like three weeks of
summer school with Kat, who failed
intro to visual arts.
CUT TO:
INT. SUMMER SCHOOL, CLASSROOM - DAY
KAT, 16, overweight, sharp and witty sits in the back left
and Jules sits in the back right.
WE SEE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN their text messages to
one another as their teacher MR. MARTIN (who’s completely
silhouetted by the classroom projector) blah blah blahs in
the background.
KAT [Gun to ur head would u fuck Mr. Martin]
JULES [hmmmm]
KAT [omg ur actually debating this?]
CLOSE ON: MR. MARTIN, still completely silhouetted as he
continues to babble on.
CUT TO:
INT. COMPLETELY SPARSE ROOM - SOMETIME
Rue talks basically to CAMERA.
RUE
Now think of all the teachers
you’ve ever had and then rank them
in order of who you’d want to fuck.
(a beat;
(MORE)
24.
she lets that sink in)
Mr. Martin is whoever in your
imagination is second to last.
BACK TO:
INT. JULES’ ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Jules finishes cleaning her scrape.
Gets a text from KAT: You wanna go to McKays party tn?
JULES: Fuck no those assholes just ran me off the road
KAT: That sucks. Sry.
Jules closes out iMessage and opens SCRUFF.
She looks through her recent matches. A litany of mostly
faceless men with super gross come-ons: P&P? I wanna ruin
you. How bigs your cock? U a twink or a real ts? U
functional? BLOCK. BLOCK. BLOCK. BLOCK. BLOCK.
And then a faceless older man in a business suit from the
neck down. His profile reads: Top only / Dominant Daddy /
Sweet and Gentle / I’m a sucker for twinks and femboys
She looks at the other photos. He’s shirtless. Fit. Another
one of his hand down his briefs. We can make out the shape of
his cock.
She taps his profile. And then a NEW MESSAGE from him.
Jules’ heart races.
She opens it: My god, you’re perfect and beautiful and how I
do I meet you for a drink?
Jules pauses... debates it. Takes a deep breath. He writes
her another message: ...tonight?
She closes SCRUFF and texts KAT: So u for sure going to
McKays?
CUT TO:
INT. MADISON’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
KAT lays on MADISON’S bed watching her get dressed. MADISON’s
in nothing but her underwear looking in the mirror.
MADISON
Do you think my areoles are weird?
RUE (CONT'D)
25.
KAT
No.
MADISON
But like the edges though?
KAT
No. They’re fine.
MADISON
Fine like they’re kind of weird or
fine like nobody but me would ever
notice what I notice?
Their other friend, BB, does her makeup at a vanity table.
BB
Fine like shut the fuck up, Maddie.
Kat responds to Jules text. [yeah] She gets up and starts to
fix her hair and makeup. Maddy tries on a top, takes it off.
MADISON
Ugh, I’m disgusting. I literally
look disgusting.
Kat looks at Maddy’s waif like figure -
KAT
You’re trippin, bitch. You need to
like snap the fuck out of this postbreakup pity party because a)
you’re hot af and b) Nate’s a
fucking loser.
MADISON
He’s not a loser. He’s a dick.
KAT
All dicks are losers.
BB
Look bottom line, you need to walk
into this party tonight like your
pussy costs a million dollars.
MADISON
For real, I’d settle for 50 grand.
They all laugh.
26.
KAT
Y’all got high standards. I’d
settle for like 4 corona lights and
non-rapey affection.
A beat.
BB
That’s kinda depressing.
KAT
Everything’s depressing, BB. Even
the things you find uplifting.
MADISON
Ugh, Nate just like totally broke
down my confidence. You know when
someone just constantly criticizes
like everything about you?
BB
That’s like, every guy.
KAT
You just need to catch a dick and
forget your troubles girl.
MADISON
(to Kat)
You just need to catch a dick.
KAT
Oh I haven’t even told you my plan
but it’s amazing. I am going to get
fucking wasted tonight and then
hunt down the most susceptible bruh
bruh I can find, and knock his ass
up in the bushes.
Maddy laughs. BB turns to her sharply:
BB
(to Kat)
Remind me again how many guys
you’ve fucked? Oh, and catfishing
doesn’t count.
We watch as KAT wilts inside. Maddy notices and turns to BB:
MADISON
(to BB)
Can you not be a cunt for like 15
seconds?
27.
A knock on the door, Maddy’s Dad, TED, 40s, pokes his head inTED
C’mon girls. Dinner’s ready--
MADISON
Dad, stop being a pervert. We’re
literally like all naked.
He closes the door quickly.
EXT. RUE’S HOUSE - EVENING
As Rue rides up, she sees her mom’s car parked out front.
RUE
Fuck.
Rue locks up her bike against a tree and enters her house -
INT. RUE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
As Rue enters WE FIND LESLIE, waiting for her in the kitchen.
LESLIE
Where were you?
RUE
(a beat)
I went to eat.
LESLIE
I don’t trust you, Rue.
RUE
What do you want me to say?
LESLIE
I want to drug test you.
RUE
Well, unfortunately I just peed.
Rue walks down the hall toward her bedroom as Leslie follows.
She slams the door behind her. ANGLE ON: GIA watching from
down the hall.
INT. RUE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Rue falls onto the bed.
28.
LESLIE (O.C.)
(through the door)
Do not slam your door.
RUE
It was an accident!
LESLIE (O.C.)
Well, you’re not leaving this house
until you take a drug test!
RUE
Whatever. I’ve got nothing to hide!
Rue waits a beat as she listens to her mom walk away.
RUE (V.O.)
Now, there’s a few ways to beat a
drug test. The first is simple:
Stop doing drugs. But if you’re in
a bind and totally fucked, you got
a few options. Some better than
others.
SLAM CUT TO:
RAPID CUTS:
RUE (V.O.)
Option one.
- QUICK DOLLY IN on RUE shoplifting a bottle of extended
release NIACIN.
RUE (V.O.)
Niacin. It’s a B vitamin that, like
breaks down fat and chemicals or
whatever. And if you take a lot of
it, like two thousand milligrams
and -
- RUE CHUGGING A GALLON OF WATER
RUE (V.O.)
- chug a few gallons of water. You
can flush your system in two to
three days. The only problem is, it
has a few side effects -
- CAMERA ROTATES AND FALLS AS RUE COLLAPSES IN HER BEDROOM.
HER SKIN FLUSHES RED and she STRUGGLES TO BREATHE.
29.
RUE (V.O.)
Skin flushing. Extreme Dizziness.
Vomiting. Rapid heartbeat and -
WE HEAR HER HEART BEAT RAPIDLY
RUE (V.O.)
Sometimes death. I don’t recommend
it, nor does any legit drug site on
the internet.
INT. RUE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
RUE (V.O.)
Option Two. Synthetic Urine.
Rue is online. A website that sells synthetic urine with a
heating powder. She clicks PURCHASE.
The price comes up $89.99 + Tax + S&H.
RUE (V.O.)
Yeah fucking right.
She clicks cancel.
INT. RUE’S BEDROOM - EVENING (RIGHT NOW)
Rue lays in bed, trying to think of how to get the fuck out
of this situation.
RUE (V.O.)
Option Three. Get a non-drug-addict
friend to piss for you.
She gets up. Opens her window. And climbs out.
EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - EVENING
Rue runs as fast as she can through the suburbs.
RUE (V.O.)
The only problem is most over the
counter home drug testing kits come
with heat sensor strips that detect
the temperature of your urine. And
if your parents watch you pee, you
can’t do the sink trick.
- RUE runs a sealed container of pee under hot water.
30.
RUE (V.O.)
So you gotta get it fresh.
I/E. LEXI’S HOUSE - EVENING
Lexi, 16, sweet with glasses, answers:
RUE
I need a favor from you.
LEXI
I’m in the middle of dinner.
RUE
Like for real, Lexi.
As they enter -
RUE (V.O.)
The side effects of this option?
CUT TO:
INT. LEXI’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Rue stands awkwardly in front of Lexi’s family eating dinner.
LEXI (O.C.)
I’ll be right back with that
eyeliner, Rue.
Lexi’s Mother SUZE, 40s, half-drunk and fueled by bored
malice looks at Rue.
SUZE
So Rue, how was rehab?
RUE
It was really, really good.
SUZE
How long have you been back?
RUE
Four days.
As Lexi comes back from the bathroom, Rue puts her hand
behind her back. Lexi covertly gives her a bottle of Ocean
Mist nasal spray. And then in front of Suze, in the other
hand, she gives her some eyeliner.
31.
Rue smiles.
CUT TO:
INT. RUE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
- CLOSE ON RUE’S LEGS as she hikes up her skirt.
- She places the bottle of nasal spray on her inner thigh,
tip down and uses masking tape to secure it in place.
- She looks in the mirror. The hem of her skirt hides it. She
opens her bedroom door.
RUE
(yells out)
Mom, I have to pee!
CUT TO:
LESLIE hands her a sterilized cup as she follows Rue to the
bathroom. Rue looks at her with a smile.
RUE (CONT’D)
I wish we could do this in a way
that wasn’t a total invasion of my
privacy.
LESLIE
Well you gave up your right to
privacy after your overdose.
RUE
That was a mistake.
LESLIE
Don’t be flip, Rue. It was the most
frightening thing a mother could
witness.
Rue motions for Leslie to turn around. She does. Rue puts the
cup below her and begins to clench her thighs together,
squeezing the bottle.
LESLIE (CONT’D)
Not to mention Gia. Who absolutely
idolizes you.
RUE
I know, Mom.
LESLIE
To have her find you unconscious -
32.
We HOLD ON RUE as she starts to tear up.
RUE
(her voice cracks)
Mom, please don’t do this...
CUT TO:
INT. RUE’S HOUSE - DAY (BEGINNING OF SUMMER)
CAMERA HOLDS ON Rue’s little sister Gia as she stands at the
end of the hallway. A strange inhuman sound coming from Rue’s
bedroom.
GIA
Rue?
No answer. Gia hesitantly walks toward Rue’s bedroom. The
sound gets a little clearer. A depressed gurgling. Like
trying to breathe through a wet cloth.
GIA (CONT’D)
Rue?
We see GIA’s hands clench the hem of her shorts, anxiously.
As she pushes open Rue’s bedroom door to see:
RUE, unconscious, on the floor, splayed out in a pool of
urine. She’s cyanotic. Her skin a faint bluish color.
And we realize the strange gurgling sound is her breathing
stomach acid back into her lungs.
BACK TO:
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
WE HOLD ON Rue’s face as her tears begin to fall.
RUE (V.O.)
I know a lot of you probably hate
me right now. And I get it.
She looks down at the cup of pee. A long beat. She hands it
to her Mother.
RUE (V.O.)
If I could be a different person, I
promise you I would.
(beat)
(MORE)
33.
Not because I want it, but because
they do. And therein lies the
catch.
As Leslie takes the test strip and plunges it into the cup.
Rue turns to her Mom.
RUE
I’m sorry for slamming the door
earlier.
LESLIE
It’s okay. I forgive you.
A beat. Rue gives her Mom a hug and starts to walk away.
ECU as the test strip comes back for all substances:
NEGATIVE. NEGATIVE. NEGATIVE. NEGATIVE.
CUT TO:
INT. JULES’ ROOM - EVENING
Jules opens a fresh needle. Plunges it into a bottle of antiandrogen (*or w/e Hormone Replacement Therapy she’d be on*)
Gets the air out. Squeezes her thigh and sticks it in.
CLOSE: AS WE SEE the plunger depress and we -
JUMP CUT TO:
INT. JULES’ ROOM - NIGHT
MONTAGE of JULES GETTING READY. Shaves. She does her makeup.
Eyeliner. Her nails. Puts on torn fishnets. A skirt. A
cropped tee.
She grabs her backpack and passes through the -
LIVING ROOM, where her DAD sits on the couch watching TV,
drinking a beer.
JULES’ DAD
Where you going?
JULES
I don’t know, out to a party.
He looks at her.
RUE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
34.
JULES’ DAD
Are you sure you wanna go out
dressed like that?
JULES
Why?
JULES’ DAD
It’s just a new school, y’know.
Listen, I don’t care how you wanna
dress, it’s just, your old school
was more open to that kinda stuff.
This is kind of a conservative
town, y’know.
JULES
I know.
A beat.
JULES’ DAD
Well, for what it’s worth, you look
nice.
JULES
Thanks, Dad.
She puts on her headphones presses PLAY as she walks out of
the house.
EXT. JULES’ HOUSE - NIGHT
She reaches into her backpack and pulls out a PINK WIG. She
puts it on as she grabs her bike and begins to ride through
the streets listening to music.
RUE (V.O.)
Jules told me later what had
happened...
CUT TO:
EXT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT
Jules, stands in the parking lot outside a grungy Best
Western on the outskirts of town.
In the distance, the room where she’s supposed to meet her
hookup. The light is on. A shadow paces back & forth inside.
35.
She looks at her phone. Texts the guy:
[i’m nervous]
[don’t be]
[promise ur not a serial killer? lol]
[haha promise]
She stands there unsure. The man texts a picture: [a bottle
of champagne and two glasses]
RUE (V.O.)
And looking back on it. She
probably would have been better off
just going to McKay’s. But...
Jules takes a deep breath and WE FOLLOW HER as she starts to
walk towards the motel. She knocks.
FROM THE SIDE WE SEE the door open as the light spills out on
Jules’ face.
A beat.
OLDER MAN’S VOICE
Come in.
As Jules passes through, the door closes behind her.
WIDE SHOT DOLLYING IN: From across the parking lot of the
illuminated window. Two silhouettes moving around the room,
circling each other.
CUT TO:
INT. MCKAY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
CAMERA WHIPS FROM NATE TO MCKAY AND A GROUP OF OTHER JOCKS as
they each pound back a shot of liquor - One after another.
CLACK. CLACK. CLACK.
SLAM CUT:
ON NATE, shirtless:
NATE
Cassie’s a whore. Fact.
The other guys start cracking up. As CAMERA WHIPS from face
to face of guys while they pre-game and talk shit.
MCKAY
Nah dude. She’s cool. She’s not
like that.
36.
NATE
Have you seen her slut pages?
MCKAY
No.
JOCKY BRO
They’re wild yo. She’s like a
downright freak.
McKay’s little brother, Skylar, 14, shirtless, backwards hat:
SKYLAR
Cassie’s on the slut pages? I gotta
see this shit.
MCKAY
What are you even doing outta your
room?
NATE
Cut the kid some slack. No one’s
coming ‘til ten.
MCKAY
All I’m saying is I think you’d dig
Cassie.
NATE
Mckay, bro. She’s a whore. Like
through and through. I’m just tryna
look out for you, fam.
MCKAY
I don’t know what she’s done, or
whatever, but she’s cool. And like
smart. She also like loves cars.
You’d like her. She knows a lot
about cars…
SKYLAR
Dude’s got mad feelings.
JOCKY BRO
For real. McKay’s about to start a
pinterest.
NATE
You don’t know what she’s done...?
He stares down McKay, who looks at him blankly.
37.
NATE (CONT’D)
Aight bro... Let’s take a trip to
the land of shame.
Nate pulls up the SLUT PAGES on his phone (a private online
inventory of nudes of girls that guys upload without their
permission to share amongst each other.)
As MCKAY throws back a shot nervously and we revolve from
FACE TO FACE in anticipation...
RUE (V.O.)
Here’s the fucking thing that
pisses me off about the world...
INT. SPARSE ROOM - SOMETIME
Rue basically talks to CAMERA.
RUE
Like every time someone’s shit gets
leaked, whether it’s J Law or
Leslie Jones, the whole world’s
like “if you don’t want it out
there, don’t take nudes in the
first place.” I’m sorry. I know
your generation relied on flowers
and father’s permission, but it’s
2018, and unless you’re Amish,
nudes are the currency of love. So
stop shaming us. Shame the assholes
who create password protected
online directories of naked
underage girls.
HARD CUT TO:
REVOLVING STILL PHOTOS from their town’s SLUT PAGES of one
girl, CASSIE, 18.
RAPID CUTS: Posing in her bedroom mirror. Naked. Legs spread.
Her hand covering her vagina. Pushing her breasts together.
Making a goofy smiling face. SNAPCHAT CAPTIONS: I [heart} u.
Miss you. Feeling sexy lol.
RUE (V.O.)
Cassie’s actually super sweet. You
remember like... from earlier -
CUT BACK TO:
38.
INT. LEXI’S HOUSE - EVENING (LIKE 5 MINUTES AGO)
CASSIE sits at the table with her mom, SUZE.
CASSIE
Rue-Rue pebbles.
RUE
How you been?
Cassie shrugs whatever.
SUZE
She’s just being coy. She has a
boyfriend she’s head over heels
for.
CASSIE
Mom, stop being retarded. He’s not
my boyfriend.
SUZE
Oooohkay. Then who was that
handsome young man who came over
for dinner last night?
CASSIE
Ohmigod, Mom.
Suze winks at Rue and then without missing a beat -
SUZE
So Rue, how was rehab...
CASSIE
(to her Mom)
You’re the actual worst.
As CAMERA WHIPS AROUND -
RUE (V.O.)
But anyway back to this bullshit...
SLAM BACK TO:
NATE, grinning:
NATE
And the Oscar goes to -
CUT TO:
39.
CASSIE’S SLUT PAGES. A GRAINY VIDEO, taken from the POV of an
iSight camera of someone we don’t recognize having sex with
Cassie. It’s unclear if Cassie knows she’s being filmed.
GUY IN VIDEO
You like it when I’m fucking rough
with you?
CASSIE
Yessss... Pleeeeeassse.
BACK TO:
NATE AND THE OTHER GUYS CRACKING UP.
NATE
You want my advice? Fuck her like
the whore she is. Throw her ass
out. And never tell a soul.
McKay sinks before the group.
RUE (V.O.)
It’s obvious that Nate got in
McKay’s head because Cassie told
Lexi, and Lexi told me, that the
night of the party -
CUT TO:
INT. MCKAY’S PARTY - KITCHEN - NIGHT
In the middle of the madness and chaos of the party, Cassie
sits on the kitchen counter. McKay stands close, looking at
her -
CASSIE
What?
MCKAY
Nothing.
CASSIE
Why are you staring me at like
that?
MCKAY
I’m sorry, I just sorta spaced out.
Cassie smiles.
MCKAY (CONT’D)
Was I being weird?
40.
CASSIE
No. You were being cute.
A beat.
MCKAY
You’re literally the most beautiful
girl I’ve ever seen.
RUE (V.O.)
- They hooked up.
INT. MCKAY’S ROOM (DURING THE PARTY) - NIGHT
Cassie and McKay make out on his bed. It’s getting more
intense. Cassie slides his hand from her waist to her bare
thigh. He looks at her. She kisses him. As he reaches under
her skirt and slides her panties off.
She falls on her side as McKay feels how wet she is.
MCKAY
Fuck.
CASSIE
I know.
MCKAY
Are you always this wet?
Cassie buries her head in the bed for a brief second -
CASSIE
Kinda... It’s super embarrassing.
He doesn’t say anything.
CASSIE (CONT’D)
(a long beat)
Does it turn you off?
McKay shakes his head, no. As he reaches into his drawer and
pulls out a condom. Starts to put it on. She watches him, her
breath slowing.
- And suddenly McKay slams into her as we see Cassie wince
uncomfortably. He smacks her ass and begins to fuck her
roughly.
- As Cassie grimaces, she turns around when suddenly he
reaches out and chokes her. Cassie panics. Her breath
constricted. Hands and legs flailing.
41.
CASSIE (CONT’D)
Stop! Stop! Stop!
WE FREEZE FRAME -
RUE (V.O.)
Now I know this looks disturbing,
but for real, I promise you, this
does not end in a rape.
(beat)
But here’s the thing -
SLAM CUT TO:
RAPID CUTS - ECU: OF BELTS, JEANS, ZIPPERS, SKIRTS,
SWEATPANTS, YOGA PANTS, ET AL. BEING PULLED DOWN, TO THE
SIDE, OPENED, TAKEN OFF.
RUE (V.O.)
Everyone on the planet watches
porn. Fact.
WE HEAR: A grunt. A sigh. A moan. A hitch of breath. And
then, RAPID MOUSE CLICKS.
RUE (V.O.)
And if were to click on the twenty
most popular videos on Pornhub
right now, this is basically what
you’d see -
A MONTAGE OF THE 20 most POPULAR SCENES on PORNHUB right now.
[*NOTE All clips should be cropped, zoomed in, and pixellated
to the point we don’t really see what’s happening. The sound
of what’s occurring should cue us more than the image]
ONE WOMAN AFTER ANOTHER is slapped in the face, choked,
spanked, dragged, spit on, cries, gags, gasps, struggles,
fights back and the only words we hear are: “C’mon slut.
Whore pussy. Fucking Cunt. Like it, pig. Bitch. You crying,
bitch? Take it, bitch. What the fuck’s wrong with you bitch?”
RUE (V.O.)
I’m not trying to be sex negative
or anything. I’m just saying -
CUT BACK TO:
UNFREEZE FRAME
As McKay immediately stops. And backs away.
42.
CASSIE
(freaked out)
Ow, what the fuck, McKay!?
RUE (V.O.)
- this shit isn’t out of fucking
left field.
MCKAY
I’m so sorry, I just thought--
CASSIE
Why would you grab me like that?
MCKAY
I don’t know. I’m sorry. I just
thought you maybe liked it - I
don’t know, I’m really sorry.
CASSIE
I just couldn’t breathe, I didn’t
expect it.
He looks stricken. On the verge of tears.
MCKAY
I’m really sorry, Cassie.
CASSIE
Just like, don’t do that again.
MCKAY
I won’t. I promise.
CASSIE
Unless you ask me.
And then Cassie smiles:
CASSIE (CONT’D)
Or I ask you.
CUT TO:
EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - NIGHT
CAMERA TILTS DOWN FROM THE NIGHT SKY -
Rue walks alone down the middle of the street in a gold
sequined hoodie.
43.
RUE (V.O.)
Anyway, I was walking to McKay’s
party because I have this rule that
I don’t drink and bike cause like -
FOUR QUICK CUTS:
- Rue, wearing sunglasses at night while riding her bike,
slams into a closed garage.
- Slams into a tree.
- Wobbles into a parked car.
- Walks her bike through the streets and slowly falls into a
bush.
CUT TO:
INT. MADISON’S CAR - NIGHT
Maddy drives as Kat sits shotgun and BB is in the back. In
the distance they see Rue walking alone in the middle of the
street.
MADISON
Who is that?
KAT
Wait, slow down. Is that Rue?
MADISON
Rue like - didn’t she die?
BB
Okay. Do not freak me out.
Kat rolls her window down, yells at Rue -
KAT
Whaddup Casper?
(As Rue turns)
Need a ride?
CUT TO:
44.
INT. MADISON’S CAR - NIGHT
As they drive through the town blasting music. Rue looks out
the window and sees the BEST WESTERN MOTEL as they pass the
motel rooms, glowing from the inside.
CUT TO:
INT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT
Jules sits on the edge of the bed in her pink wig and skirt.
Her knees fall into one another. A glass of champagne is
handed to her from O.S.
JULES
Thanks.
REVERSE. An OLDER MAN, 40s, handsome. Clean shaven. In a nice
button down shirt. There’s a calmness to him. Casualness.
OLDER MAN
How old are you?
JULES
Twenty-two.
OLDER MAN
Do you live in town?
JULES
(a beat)
No.
(a beat)
I’m just visiting my grandparents.
OLDER MAN
Hmm...
JULES
What about you?
A long beat.
OLDER MAN
You live like this?
JULES
What do you mean?
OLDER MAN
Is this how you look generally?
45.
JULES
I mean... For like the last six
months.
He nods. Sips his champagne.
OLDER MAN
You’re beautiful.
JULES
Thank you.
OLDER MAN
I’m envious of your generation. You
know? You guys don’t care as much
about the rules, you know. I think
it’s a good thing.
Jules nods for the sake of nodding.
OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
And I don’t want to be that old guy
that gives you advice. But I look
at you, and think there’s two
versions of how your life can go...
She looks at him.
OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
You can either go someplace where
you’re wanted for who you are... Or
you stay in a town like this and
end up like me, living your life
out in motel rooms.
Jules nods. The OLDER MAN moves closer. He uses his knee to
push Jules’ legs open. He stands over her. Puts his hand
under her chin and lifts her face up:
OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
Selfishly... I hope you stay.
He runs his thumb across Jules’ lips. Pushes it in her mouth.
Jules doesn’t break eye contact. He uses his thumb to pull
her mouth open.
OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
You have a great mouth.
Jules’ breath slows, as he pushes her jaw down, opening her
mouth even more.
OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
Wider... Wider...
46.
He pushes his knee into Jules’ crotch. Her thighs clench
around his leg. As he opens her mouth wider and wider.
OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
There you go. That’s it.
(a beat)
Good girl.
CUT TO:
INT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - LATER
WE HOLD ON Jules’ face, her lipstick and mascara smeared, as
her face is pushed down into the bed.
RUE (V.O.)
Jules once told me that every night
when she was a kid, like five or
something, she’d lock herself in
the bathroom, get down on her hands
and knees, and pray to God.
WE hear the SOUND of her fishnets being torn open. He reaches
around and jams his fingers in her mouth. She gags.
OLDER MAN
Spit.
She spits in his hand. JULES takes a deep breath as the OLDER
MAN starts to fuck her.
RUE (V.O.)
She’d pray that when she woke up in
the morning, she’d be 25 years old.
She’d live with her best friend, a
girl. Someone she hadn’t met yet
but someone she knew she’d trust
forever.
The OLDER MAN holds Jules’ wrists against her chest as he
grunts. Jules just looks straight ahead, emotionless.
RUE (V.O.)
I don’t know why but when she told
me that story I started to cry so
hard that I hyperventilated. Jules
just kept laughing and saying
“What’s wrong?” But I didn’t know.
The OLDER MAN whispers in Jules' ear:
47.
OLDER MAN
You’re so clean. You don’t know how
rare that is.
CUT TO:
INT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT
THE SOUND OF A SHOWER RUNNING as Jules lays in bed alone. She
looks at the nightstand table – the OLDER MAN’S phone lies
there. She reaches over and presses the home screen – the
phone lights up:
The wallpaper is an old family photo – the OLDER MAN looks
about 10 years younger, his arm slung around a PRETTY WIFE,
two young sons posing in front in matching polo shirts.
The CLOCK READS: 11:33PM.
CUT TO BLACK:
RUE (V.O.)
And then, the night got weird.
INT. MCKAY’S PARTY - BATHROOM - NIGHT
“BOW DOWN” by RAMSEY begins to play -
As RUE swoops down into frame and snorts a crushed Oxycontin
off the baby-blue tile of the sink. She leans back as the
CAMERA rises into a TOP SHOT. She opens the bathroom door -
INT. MCKAY’S PARTY - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
A crush of people drinking, smoking, talking, and hooking up
in the hallway.
[*** NOTE: The following plays in a single take and should be
the druggy teenage equivalent of the Fred Astaire dance
sequence in ROYAL WEDDING (1951)]
RUE starts to head down the hallway, trying to find her
balance and footing as the drug takes effect. She leans
against the wall.
SUDDENLY, SHE BEGINS TO CRAWL UP the side of the wall. The
rest of the kids remain oblivious and fixed to the floor.
Rue stands up on the right side of the wall. Her balance
wobbly as she continues to walk, bracing herself against the
ceiling.
48.
When suddenly, she weaves, loses her footing and steps up on
the ceiling, walking upside down over the other kids and
toward the end of the hall.
As she nears the end, she steps onto the left side of the
wall, takes a step or two, and hops back down onto the floor
where the rest of the kids have remained fixed throughout.
And she disappears into the crowd.
RUE (V.O.)
Now, there’s a couple versions of
what happened that night. There’s
the real version and then the
version I told the cops. Now, the
version I told the cops was far
less interesting... because, like
obviously.
INT. MCKAY’S PARTY - MOMENTS LATER
FROM ABOVE: WE SEE NATE, shirtless, pound back an enormous
amount of liquor.
RUE (V.O.)
But Nate was fucking on one.
AND WE BEGIN TO SPIN WITH HIM, as he heads toward a RANDOM
HOT GIRL and pulls her on the dance floor.
RANDOM HOT GIRL
Where are you taking me?
NATE
I wanna see how you move.
RANDOM HOT GIRL
Oh yeah?
NATE
Fuck yeah.
As she begins to grind on him, he slides his hands over her
ass and grips it tight. He turns and throws MADDY a look.
RUE (V.O.)
And in turn, Maddy was fucking on
one.
WE SPIN OVER TO:
FROM ABOVE
49.
MADISON is pulling some COLLEGE GUY through the party, past
NATE, on the dance floor, who’s now making out with RANDOM
HOT GIRL. Nate looks up as Maddy pulls College Guy -
- toward the SLIDING GLASS DOOR and CAMERA DROPS DOWN BEHIND
MADDY as she steps -
OUTSIDE
- Into the warm night and begins to strip down into her bra
and panties. Everyone in the pool turns and watches as
COLLEGE GUY frantically follows suit, stripping down to his
boxers.
- As MADDY PULLS HIM into the POOL and WE CRASH UNDERWATER
WITH THEM, getting lost in the flailing limbs and waves and
bubbles until we find them again swimming out into the deep
end.
- The trap bass of the music echoes underwater as we see
MADDY hold him and kiss him underwater. They laugh and tumble
and surface.
- As MADDY wraps her legs around him, holds his neck and
begins to grind herself into him. She moves her hips around
to the beat of the music as he looks at her, in awe.
COLLEGE GUY
You’re fucking crazy.
She continues to ride him in the pool.
MADISON
You think I’m crazy?
COLLEGE GUY
Definitely.
MADISON
What if...?
Madison looks around at everyone else in the pool, pretending
not to watch them.
She leans in, whispers in his ear:
MADISON (CONT’D)
What if I told you that I wanted
you to fuck me right here, right
now?
OFF COLLEGE GUY’S stunned face -
50.
RUE (V.O.)
And that’s right about the time
that Jules decided to ghost his
hookup and bike over to McKay’s.
CUT TO:
EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - NIGHT
Jules, in her pink wig, pedals as fast as she can through the
streets.
RUE (V.O.)
Now Jules texted Kat but Kat didn’t
answer because...
CUT TO:
INT. SKYLAR’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
- WE PUSH THROUGH A CLOUD OF WEED SMOKE to find KAT sitting
across from (McKay’s younger brother) SKYLAR and his friend
NICK, both 14.
They’re both shirtless. Listening to rap.
SKYLAR
What’s the deal with your friend.
BB.
KAT
What about her?
SKYLAR
Is she like a prude or is she like
a slut?
KAT
Definitely a slut.
NICK
What about you?
KAT
What about me?
NICK
Are you a slut?
She looks him dead in the eye, unblinking, lying:
51.
KAT
Yeah, I’m a fucking savage.
He smiles.
NICK
What’s your number?
KAT
Higher than you can count.
NICK
Stop playing, you’re a fuckin’
prude.
A beat. Kat shrugs.
RUE (V.O.)
Now Kat wasn’t a prude but she was
a virgin. She told Jules that a
week into summer school and when
Kat saw her reaction -
SLAM CUT TO:
CLOSE ON: JULES’ REACTION - DAY
JULES
(stunned and disturbed)
This isn’t the 80’s bitch. You need
to catch a dick.
BACK TO:
INT. SKYLAR’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Back to Kat smoking weed with Skylar and Nick.
RUE (V.O.)
She was on a mission to enter
Junior year as a woman of
questionable morals.
NICK
Stop playing, you’re a fuckin’
prude.
A beat. Kat shrugs.
NICK (CONT’D)
If I were to pull my dick out right
now, would you suck it?
52.
Nick starts to laugh, but Kat doesn’t break eye contact.
KAT
I don’t know, let me see it.
NICK
I’m not hard yet.
He puts his hand down his pants and starts jacking off under
his clothes as they talk.
NICK (CONT’D)
You’ve probably never sucked a dick
in your life.
KAT
Yeah I have.
We can see that Kat enjoys the back and forth power-play.
Skylar takes a swig from a bottle of liquor. Passes it to
Kat. Who takes a big swig. Passes it to Nick.
SKYLAR
Most girls don’t know how to suck
dick.
KAT
What do you mean?
SKYLAR
They’re too gentle, like they’re
fuckin’ scared of it.
KAT
Not in porn.
NICK
(he smiles)
Exactly. You watch porn?
KAT
Doesn’t everyone?
NICK
Every guy, yeah. But not prudes,
only sluts.
KAT
(with a smile)
Yeah well.
He looks her dead in the eye.
53.
NICK
You know what people always say?
Fat girls give the best head.
Off Kat’s face, inscrutable -
CUT TO:
RUE (V.O.)
I was out back talking to Fezco
when Jules arrived.
EXT. MCKAYS PARTY - POOL - NIGHT
WE SEE Rue and Fezco laying on pool chairs smoking a joint
and barely paying attention to Maddy and College Guy as they
sorta or actually fuck in the pool.
We can see Fezco is contemplating something and then finally:
FEZCO
You know, I try to keep things
straight business, but... When I
saw you come in today the whole
thing made me uneasy.
RUE
Aw, don’t go soft on me Fezco.
FEZCO
Nah, I mean it, Rue. I like you. I
missed you. And that shit at the
beginning of the summer really
scared me.
RUE
Yeah, you and everyone else.
He looks at her, dead serious.
FEZCO
I’m not being flip, Rue. I’ve been
in the drug game for six years and
I’ve seen a bunch of people die.
But none like you.
She winces, tries to avert her eyes.
FEZCO (CONT’D)
I don’t know what the fuck you got
going on inside of you, and I don’t
know how to fix it, but trust me,
this shit ain’t the answer.
54.
A beat as Rue collects her thoughts.
RUE
I remember when I was 11 years old -
a month or two after my Dad got
diagnosed… and we got the results
from the prognosis - and it was
really good like 80/20. And we had
a little celebration, ordered a ton
of Chinese food and that night I
was laying in bed between my
parents, and we were watching a
Seinfeld rerun. And suddenly… I
couldn’t breathe. It was like the
world was no longer filled with
oxygen. I was gasping, panicking.
And they called the ambulance. They
thought maybe I had an allergic
reaction, and when I got to the
hospital, they gave me liquid
Valium to calm me down. And I
remember the moment it hit me, I
thought… ‘Oh, this is what I’ve
been searching for. My entire life,
for as long as I can remember.’
Because suddenly the whole world
went quiet and I felt safe in my
own mind.
(a beat)
2 years later, he was gone. My
panic attacks stayed. But I found a
way to live.
She thinks for a beat. Looks over at Fezco.
RUE (CONT’D)
And will it eventually kill me?...
Probably.
(with a smile)
So you still gonna be my dealer,
Fezco?
He stares at her.
FEZCO
You’re a fuckin’ trip, Rue. And I
am way too high for this
conversation.
As she takes another hit of the joint -
55.
RUE (V.O.)
Maybe things would have been
different if I was inside when it
all started, but I wasn’t.
EXT. MCKAY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
FROM BEHIND: Jules, in her pink wig, looks at the house party
in the distance. It’s lit up. Music echoes. The windows are
fogged up. She looks at her phone. Nervous.
She takes a deep breath as we begin to follow her and she
walks toward the party -
INT. MCKAY’S PARTY - CONTINUOUS
WE SEE JOCKY BRO whisper something to NATE, who’s rip-roaring
drunk. He turns and begins to push through the crowd of
people surrounding the pool.
He sees MADDY in the pool, hooking up with COLLEGE GUY.
A few kids film it on the low and/or snap it.
CUT TO:
INT. MCKAY’S PARTY - CONTINUOUS
Jules enters in her pink wig, crop top, torn fishnets, and
smeared mascara.
A few kids notice, gawking at her. She then heads straight to
the kitchen table of liquor and pours herself a big cup of
vodka. She throws it back.
OUTSIDE AT THE POOL
Nate yells out to Maddy -
NATE
Real classy, you fucking whore!
She looks up to see Nate and ignores him. As he heads back
inside, we can see his fists balling. His rage mounting.
He heads for the liquor table. Sees Jules standing there.
Nate just looks at her, not saying anything... And then -
NATE (CONT’D)
You wanna tell me who the fuck you
are?
56.
Jules, a little confused -
JULES
I’m Jules, I’m a friend of -
NATE
A friend? You’re not my friend.
(yelling to the Party)
Anyone else here friends with
Jules?
Jules senses where this is headed... People start to crowd
around Nate and Jules.
JULES
Look, I’m just minding my own
business. I’m not trying--
NATE
No one who looks like you is
minding their own business. You
want attention. Don’t you?
(she says nothing)
Cause I’ll give you some fucking
attention.
Nate looks around -
NATE (CONT’D)
Anyone friends with this faggot?
The whole party is silent.
NATE (CONT’D)
If someone doesn’t speak up, this
bitch is gonna get fucked up!
Jules looks over at the counter and sees a kitchen knife
lying next to a cut up lime.
NATE (CONT’D)
Looks like you’re all on your own.
Jules tries to walk away but Nate grabs her and throws her
back against the wall.
Jules immediately REACHES OVER AND GRABS THE KITCHEN KNIFE.
It’s pandemonium as everyone tries to leave/talk the
situation down, etc.
57.
NATE (CONT’D)
Dude, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I was
just fucking with you, just put the
knife down, dude.
But Jules loses it, all the rage and emotion from the entire
evening pouring out of her.
JULES
You wanna hurt me, huh? You think
you can hurt me?
NATE
What the fuck are you talking
about?
Rue hears the commotion and comes into the kitchen to see
what’s going on. Jules is still holding the knife, screaming.
JULES
You think you can hurt me? Well
guess what, no one can hurt me like
I can hurt myself.
Jules takes the KNIFE and SLICES HER OWN ARM. Blood pours
from her. People begin to freak out.
JULES (CONT’D)
See! I’m fuckin’ invincible!
She bats her arm towards Nate, smearing the blood around the
kitchen.
NATE
You’re a fuckin’ psychopath!
Nate backs off as the fight goes out of her. Jules looks
around at the stunned party. Throws the bloody knife in the
sink.
People separate as Jules walks through the party toward the
front door. Blood runs down her arm and fingers, trailing
her. Before she leaves, she turns to everyone.
JULES
By the way, I’m Jules. And I just
moved here.
CLOSE ON. Rue as a big smile forms on her face.
RUE (V.O.)
I mean, right...?
CUT TO:
58.
EXT. MCKAY’S PARTY - MOMENTS LATER
As Jules walks out of the party toward her bike, Rue runs out
after her.
RUE
Yo, that was the dopest thing I’ve
ever seen.
Jules turns to see Rue running toward her -
JULES
What?
RUE
That was fucking amazing.
JULES
Well, it became a situation where I
knew like, some amount of violence
was going to be done to me. And I
don’t want a fuckin’ broken
cheekbone or some shit.
(then)
So like, whatever. I got a couple
of cuts.
RUE
No I completely understand the
logic behind it, but it’s still
fuckin’ insane…
The two of them look at each other and in an instant realize
they’re about to become best friends.
RUE (CONT’D)
I’m Rue.
JULES
I’m Jules.
RUE
Where you going?
JULES
Home, probably.
RUE
Can I come with you?
Jules smiles.
CUT TO:
59.
INT. MCKAYS PARTY - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Kat exits Skylar’s room and walks down the hall as CAMERA
holds on her face, numb.
She’s sweaty. Her hair is all messed up.
She looks at her phone. A bunch of texts from Jules about 45
minutes ago.
Suddenly, Maddy comes running toward her -
MADISON
Where the fuck have you been? You
missed the craziest shit ever -
Kat looks at her and smiles. Maddy’s like: what?
KAT
Guess who just lost their
virginity?
Maddy squeals in delight.
MADISON
Oh my god, oh my god, with who!?
KAT
I, uh, I think he goes to St.
Mary’s.
MADISON
Oh my god, no way! How was it?
Kat takes a beat, then lies.
KAT
It was... nice.
She shrugs, as Madison wraps her arms around her in a hug.
MADISON
Aw, my little slut, I’m so proud of
you!
CUT TO:
EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - NIGHT
Rue holds onto Jules as they ride her bike back home. Rue
clings to her, the blood soaking through her shirt and into
her clothes.
60.
INT. JULES’ HOME - NIGHT
They tiptoe through her house and into...
INT. JULES’ ROOM - SAME
Rue and Jules strip out of their bloody clothes and down to
their underwear. Rue begins to bandage her arm.
CUT TO:
INT. MCKAY’S HOME - NIGHT
Cassie sleeps peacefully as McKay cuddles her. He quietly and
gently kisses the back of her neck as she sleeps.
CUT TO:
INT. MADISON’S HOME - NIGHT
Maddy is passed out in her bed next to BB. CAMERA drifts over
to the floor where KAT lays in a makeshift bed of blankets,
scrolling through Skylar and Nick’s instagrams.
They’re both total fuckboys. Constantly shirtless, their arms
draped around random hot girls. None of whom look like Kat.
CUT TO:
INT. SPARSE ROOM - SOMETIME
WE PULL OUT of the back of Rue’s head to REVEAL the SHERIFF
and a COP sitting across from her.
We can see that the Sheriff is at his wits end with Rue.
SHERIFF
Just tell us in a simple
straightforward way what happened
on the night of August 24th.
RUE
Was that the day the mall got shot
up?
SHERIFF
What mall?
61.
RUE
The one in the south, that like,
that white supremacist dude shot
up.
SHERIFF
I don’t know what mall shooting
you’re referring to.
RUE
It was the one that happened the
day of McKay’s party.
SHERIFF
On August 24th?
RUE
I don’t know. It’s not like I’m
forty and keep a day planner.
As the Cops look at each other in frustration.
RUE (V.O.)
So I’ve watched like a lot of true
crime docs and I’m always amazed at
like, how quickly criminals crack.
Like if you’re gonna have the balls
to commit a crime, then you’d think
you’d have the balls to lie about
it. Whatever. Point is - the first
rule of fight club... Don’t trust
the motherfucking cops.
CUT TO:
EXT. NATE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Nate weaves his car drunkenly down the streets. He gets out.
Drunk. And walks toward the front door of his house.
RUE (V.O.)
Remember when I said things got
weird...?
INT. NATE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Nate closes the front door and drops his car keys in the bowl
in the front hall. WE HOLD on A FRAMED PICTURE behind it.
It’s a photo of NATE’S FAMILY, taken years ago. And WE
REALIZE it’s the SAME PHOTO from the phone of the OLDER MAN
Jules hooked up with.
62.
RUE (V.O.)
So yeahhhh...
BACK TO:
INT. SPARSE ROOM - SOMETIME
The Sheriff looks at Rue.
SHERIFF
Just tell us what happened the
night of Christopher McKay’s party.
RUE
(hesitates and then:)
Can I be completely honest?
SHERIFF
I hope so -
RUE
I got really fucking high that
night. So I’ll try to tell you what
happened but I can’t like promise
it’s, for real, what actually
happened... You know what I mean?
The Cops look at each other, overwhelmingly frustrated.
CUT TO:
INT. JULES’ ROOM - NIGHT
Jules lays back in bed as Rue sits astride her, finishing
bandaging her arm.
They’re both in their underwear… There’s a certain sexual
tension but it’s mostly platonic.
Rue leans down and kisses her cheek. Sits up. Looks over her
shoulder, away from us.
RUE
I have an idea...
She turns back, looks down at Jules with a little smile.
RUE (CONT’D)
Wanna get high?
END OF PILOT.
63.
