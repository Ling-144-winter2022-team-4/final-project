1. Annotation scheme
  
  We propose to use an annotation scheme where we create a spreadsheet that organizes our data based on categories like source of data, uh/um, , utterance, location of the utterance, etc.
  
3. Proposes a way of filtering your data to a more representative set

We intend of filtering the data for utterances that only contain the disfluencies "uh" or "um." 

5. proposes additional manipulations that you need to run on the data

We will have to define what an "utterance" according to our data and then use that definition to count the amount of "uh" utterances and "um" utterances.
